# Genesis Boilerplate
Genesis boilerplate is a starter kit for Genesis child themes based on Skeleton CSS.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details about the Skeleton CSS framework.

## Getting started

To start your new child theme with Genesis Boilerplate, you can [Download the files from GitHub]() or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/Genesis-Boilerplate.git`. You can then upload the files under Appearances -> Themes in your Wordpress Dashboard, although you'll probably want to add some styles before you do. Remember this is a starting point for a custom theme and pretty vanilla as it is.

### What's in the download?

The download includes a rewrite of Skeleton CSS to use standard Genesis classes and a functions file to get you started building a custom Genesis child theme.

You'll want to add a [screenshot.png file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot) so something will show in the Wordpress Dashboard. You'll probably want to add an /images directory, and if you intend to use Javascript, a /js directory.
